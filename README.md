# Introduction

This document was created to help you keep your code consistent and clean. It covers basic PHP coding rules as well as Symfony-specific coding standards, which you are encouraged to follow for the greater good of us all and for the glory of the Company. Please, feel encouraged, or else.

**First thing you need to read**, is [Clean Code concepts for PHP](https://github.com/ucreate-marcinw/clean-code-php). It's a lot of reading, but it is a really valuable set of instructions and rules.

**Second**, if you have some time - and you should find some for it - is [PHP the Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com), which has everything you need to know and something more.
